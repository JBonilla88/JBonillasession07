                <h2>WHAT IS A PISOLITHUS ARHIZUS?</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Pisolithus arhizus or Pisolithus Tinctorius is a widespread earth-ball like fungus. This amazing
                        mushroom starts out looking like a tough, walnut- to baseball-sized puffball, but eventually
                        develops into a minor monstrosity that sticks up from the ground like a dusty stump.
                        Progressively from the top, the whole of the fruitbody turns into a soft mass of brown
                        spore-bearing powder. At maturity, cracks appear in the upper surface and the spores blow away
                        on the breeze or get washed away to new locations in wet weather. Because it forms mycorrhizas
                        with almost any kind of root, this ectomycorrhizal fungus is frequently used by foresters (and
                        in recent years by gardeners, too) as the basis of a soil inoculant to promote tree and plant
                        growth - particularly in the remediation of areas of degraded or polluted land or formerly
                        clear-felled forest sites. The black viscous gel is used as a natural dye for clothes.
                        Pisolithus arhizus is a major component in mycorrhizal fungus mixtures that are used in
                        gardening as powerful root stimulators. Common names: Dead Man's Foot, Dyeball, Horse Dung
                        Fungus, Perdebal, Bohemian Truffle.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ecology: Mycorrhizal with pines, oaks, and cedars; growing alone, scattered, or in small groups;
                        often found in gravel, sandy soil, in ditches, on lawns, and so on; summer and fall, or over
                        winter in warm climates; southern Europe, Africa, and Japan. The illustrated and described
                        collection is from the Italian Riviera.
                        <br><br>
                        Fruiting Body: 5–16 cm high; 4–10 cm across; ball-shaped to top-shaped when young, with a
                        narrowed, not-quite-stemlike base; stretching out with maturity to become top-shaped to widely
                        cylindric; outer surface at first very pale brownish to dull yellowish or nearly whitish,
                        developing cracks and fissures, and eventually breaking up to expose the interior; outer rind
                        about 1 mm thick, fragile; interior at first packed with pea-sized, yellowish to whitish or
                        cinnamon brown spore packages embedded in blackish gel, disintegrating from the top downward to
                        become a mass of cinnamon brown spore dust; basal area with yellowish to brownish flesh.
                        <br><br>
                        Odor: Not distinctive.
                        <br><br>
                        Spore Print: Cinnamon brown.
                        <br><br>
                        Microscopic Features: Spores 5–8 µm excluding ornamentation; globose; densely echinate with
                        isolated spines 1–1.5 µm long and about 0.5 µm wide at the base; thick-walled; golden in KOH.

                    <h3>Geography</h3>
                    <p>Documented from southern Europe, Africa, and Japan, Pisolithus arhizus is a mycorrhizal associate
                        of pines, oaks, and cedars. It features a pale, nearly whitish "shell" that encases an interior
                        composed, initially, of pea-sized spore packages. As the fungus matures, cinnamon-colored spore
                        dust replaces the spore packages, beginning at the top of the mushroom and moving downward.
                        Eventually, the whole thing disintegrates and spore dust is released.
                        <br><br>
                        Within southern Europe, similar species include Pisolithus albus and Pisolithus microcarpus
                        (both associated with eucalyptus and featuring smaller spores), Pisolithus arenarius (with a
                        somewhat darker outer skin), and Pisolithus calongei (associated with rockroses, spines on
                        spores often coalescing).
                        <br><br>
                        The illustrated and described collection, from the Italian Riviera, was made in an urban grove
                        of one of my favorite trees, stone pine, well known to the world from Italian landscapes in film
                        and paintings, featuring stunning mature bark and a sparse, umbrella-shaped crown.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the species name arhizus is widely applied in North America, recent research (Martin et
                        al. 2002, Lebel et al. 2018) does not support the idea; see Pisolithus arenarius for the North
                        American species.

                    <blockquote id="paragraph1">
                        "Pisolithus arhizus needs to be emulsified with water to ensure it gets absorbed. I use a
                        special homemade emulsifier my friend Michael Beug gave me but you can easily use some pH
                        neutral dish soap. It also really loves to soak in water for as long as possible. The longer you
                        soak it the more color you will extract. It soaked for 5 days before I cooked up the dye bath. I
                        have never been successful at getting a clear lake from Pisolithus. Pigment settles to the
                        bottom but the liquid is incredibly dark and filled with color. I save this filtered liquid,
                        evaporate it down and use it for ink. It works beautifully.".

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>This mushroom was described in 1786 by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. Treating it as a
                puffball, Scopoli gave this fungus the binomial scientific name Lycoperdon arrizon.
                <br><br>
                In 1801 Christiaan Hendrik Persoon retained (but with an 'h') the specific epithet when he included this
                species with other earthballs in the genus Scleroderma.
                <br><br>
                From 1928 this fungus was known (and still is in some modern field guides) as Pisolithus tinctorius -
                that specific epithet referring to its use in dyeing fabrics.
                <br><br>
                It was not until 1959 that the Dyeball became generally known by its current scientific name, which was
                proposed by German Stephan Rauschert (1931 - 1986).
                <br><br>
                The generic name Pisolithus comes from two Greek words: Piso- meaning a pea, and lith meaning a stone,
                while the specific epithet arrhizus means 'having no roots'. Pisolithus arrhizus therefore translates to
                rootless pea-stone.
